    {
      "stem": "An acyanotic newborn presents with a harsh heart murmur at the left sternal edge. The chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "ASD",
        "Tricuspid atresia",
        "Transposition of the great arteries",
        "VSD"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A harsh heart murmur at the left sternal edge, along with cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings on a chest X-ray in an acyanotic newborn, is characteristic of a Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) with a significant left-to-right shunt."
    },
    {
      "stem": "During regular checkup of an 8 year old child, you note a loud first heart sound with fixed and widely split second heart sound at the upper left sternal border that does not change with respiration. The patient is otherwise active and healthy. Which of the following most likely explains these findings?",
      "options": [
        "Aortic stenosis",
        "Atrial septal defect",
        "Tetralogy of Fallot.",
        "Ventricular septal defect."
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound that does not change with respiration is a classical sign of Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). The increased blood flow through the pulmonary valve due to the left-to-right shunt causes a pulmonary ejection systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border."

    {
      "stem": "A 7-year-old boy had a sore throat two weeks ago. His mother is worried that he may be at risk for rheumatic fever. You tell her that several criteria must be met to make the diagnosis. The most common finding in rheumatic fever is:",
      "options": [
        "Arthralgia.",
        "Carditis.",
        "Erythema marginatum.",
        "Subcutaneous nodules."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The most common major criterion for rheumatic fever is polyarthritis, affecting 70% of cases. However, the most common finding is arthralgia, or joint pain, which is considered a minor criterion."

    {
      "stem": "A 1-month-baby presents with breathlessness and poor feeding. Her mother says she has been getting worse over the last week. On examination she is found to have a large liver, a respiratory rate of 60/min, and an active precordium with a soft murmur. Her oxygen saturation is 94% and she has good femoral pulses. What would you advise as the most appropriate treatment?",
      "options": [
        "Restrict milk feeds and fluids.",
        "Start captopril in casualty and follow her in the clinic in 1 month.",
        "Start digoxin and diuretics and follow her in the clinic after 3 months.",
        "Start diuretics and admit to the ward for observation."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of breathlessness, poor feeding, large liver, and tachypnea, with an active precordium, are signs of congestive heart failure. The initial management of heart failure in a distressed infant includes supportive measures and diuretic therapy to reduce preload. Hospital admission is indicated for infants with heart failure."
    },
    {
      "stem": "One day old baby who is otherwise asymptomatic presents with a loud harsh heart murmur at the 2nd left space. There are no features of heart failure present, the oxygen saturation is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?",
      "options": [
        "Atrial septal defect.",
        "Large muscular ventricular septal defect.",
        "Pulmonary stenosis",
        "Small muscular ventricular septal defect."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A loud harsh heart murmur at the second left intercostal space in an otherwise asymptomatic newborn with normal oxygen saturation is characteristic of a small pulmonary stenosis. An isolated small VSD would produce a holosystolic murmur, not just a systolic murmur, and would not necessarily be loud in a one-day-old baby due to high pulmonary pressure."

    {
      "stem": "A 1 month baby severely cyanosed is diagnosed as having Fallot tetralogy following an echocardiogram. After stabilization parents ask you to tell them what will be the next step?",
      "options": [
        "A balloon atrial septostomy is the treatment of choice.",
        "The baby should be taken to theatre to have the ventricular septal defect closed",

        "The baby should be taken to theatre to have a pulmonary artery band applied"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Fallot's tetralogy involves decreased pulmonary blood flow due to pulmonary stenosis. The Blalock-Taussig shunt is a palliative surgical procedure that connects the subclavian artery to the ipsilateral pulmonary artery to increase pulmonary blood flow and reduce cyanosis. This is a suitable intervention for a severely cyanosed infant with Fallot's tetralogy."

      "stem": "A 4 year old male presents for a preschool physical examination. His mother mentions that he seems to get short of breath with exercise recently. On examination radial pulse is prominent while femoral pulse is not felt. A systolic murmur is heard on the left side of the chest. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Congenital aortic stenosis",
        "Coarctation of the aorta",
        "Severe pulmonary stenosis",
        "Ventricular septal defect"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A prominent radial pulse with a weak or absent femoral pulse is the classic sign of coarctation of the aorta, a localized narrowing of the aorta that causes a pressure gradient and lower blood pressure in the lower part of the body compared to the upper part. The systolic murmur is also a consistent finding."

        "Brain tumor",
        "Infective endocarditis",
        "Meningitis"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A child with Fallot's tetralogy is at risk for brain abscesses due to the right-to-left shunt bypassing the lung filter. The symptoms of fever, lethargy, and headache are consistent with a central nervous system infection like a brain abscess."

      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Progressive deepening of cyanosis since birth without respiratory distress, a single second heart sound, and cardiomegaly with a 'special configuration' on chest X-ray are hallmark signs of Transposition of the great arteries (TGA). The single S2 is due to the anterior displacement of the aorta."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The squatting position is a compensatory mechanism used by older children with Fallot's tetralogy to increase systemic vascular resistance, which helps to increase pulmonary blood flow and decrease cyanosis. The sudden onset of deep cyanosis, restlessness, and unresponsiveness describes a hypercyanotic spell, which is a key complication of Fallot's tetralogy."
