      "stem": "A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room with a 3-hour history of fever 39.5C and sore throat. The child appears anxious and toxic. He has mild inspiratory stridor and he is drooling. He is sitting on the examination table leaning forward with his neck extended. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management of the patient?",
      "options": [
        "Place him in a mist tent",
        "Examine the throat and obtain a culture",
        "Obtain an arterial blood gas and start an IV line",
        "Prepare to establish an airway"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of high fever, toxic appearance, drooling, and sitting in a forward-leaning position with the neck extended (tripod position) is highly suggestive of acute epiglottitis. This is a life-threatening condition where the epiglottis swells and can rapidly lead to complete airway obstruction. The most critical immediate management is to prepare for establishing a definitive airway, as any manipulation or examination of the throat can precipitate complete obstruction."

    {
      "stem": "A 9 months old child presents to ER department with croup. On examination he has marked stridor at rest and a barking cough. What should this baby be treated with?",
      "options": [
        "Intramuscular adrenaline.",
        "Intravenous antibiotics.",
        "Nebulized adrenaline and oral dexamethasone.",
        "Nebulized salbutamol."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The textbook states that croup is caused by a viral infection and presents with a barking cough and harsh stridor. The treatment plan for a child with marked stridor at rest (Grade II stridor) includes hospitalization and medical management. The standard approach involves oxygen therapy, warm steam inhalation, and corticosteroids to decrease laryngeal edema. Nebulized adrenaline is used for severe stridor to help relieve the obstruction."

    {
      "stem": "A 6y old boy presents to ER with throat tightness, urticarial rash, lip and tongue edema. On examination he has tachycardia, heart rate 200 beats/min hypotension and wheezy chest. What is the initial lifesaving medication for this child?",
      "options": [
        "Antihistaminic",
        "Corticosteroids.",
        "Fluid bolus.",
        "IM adrenaline."
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient's symptoms of urticaria, lip and tongue edema, respiratory distress (wheezy chest, throat tightness), tachycardia, and hypotension following exposure to a potential trigger are classic for anaphylaxis. The most important and immediate life-saving medication for anaphylaxis is intramuscular (IM) epinephrine (adrenaline)."

You note that his face is flushed and his voice sounds muffled and strained. Which of the following is the first priority in managing this episode of anaphylaxis?",
      "options": [
        "Administration of corticosteroids",
        "Administration of oxygen",
        "Endotracheal intubation",
        "IM injection of 1:1000 epinephrine"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient is experiencing an acute, systemic, life-threatening allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, triggered by a pollen extract injection. The first and most important priority in the management of anaphylaxis is the administration of epinephrine (adrenaline). The dosage mentioned is IM 1:1000 epinephrine, which is the standard concentration for intramuscular injection."

      "stem": "Seven years old child presented to ER after a car accident. He was in deep coma with convulsions. His pupils were dilated fixed and non-reactive. He had irregular breathing, bradycardia and hypotension. Initial investigations showed low hemoglobin (5 g/dl) What is the first management step?",
      "options": [
        "Anticonvulsants",
        "Blood transfusion",
        "IV fluids",
        "Keep clear airway and good ventilation"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The primary survey in an emergency approach to a critical illness follows the ABCDE steps. The first and most critical step is to secure the airway and ensure adequate breathing, as most cardiac arrests in children are secondary to respiratory compromise. This is prioritized over treating other issues, such as convulsions, fluid deficits, or low hemoglobin, as the patient's immediate survival depends on a patent airway and good ventilation."

      "stem": "A 5-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a 12-hour history of fever and respiratory distress. On physical examination, the girl appears toxic, is drooling, and leaning forward with her chin extended. She has a temperature of (40° C) and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Anaphylaxis",
        "Bacterial pneumonia",
        "Croup",
        "Epiglottitis"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "This clinical presentation is a classic description of acute epiglottitis. The key features are the toxic appearance, high fever, drooling, and the specific posture of leaning forward with the chin extended. This posture is adopted by the patient to maximize the airway opening. Viral croup typically has a prodrome of milder fever and a barking cough, which is absent here."

      "stem": "You are evaluating a 10-year-old male who was struck by a car. On physical examination, he is breathing spontaneously. There is a large hematoma on his forehead. His eyes open in response to painful stimuli, and his pupils are equal and reactive to light. He vocalizes by incomprehensibly moaning. When you pinch his right arm, he attempts to push your arm away. Which of the following is appropriate to start with?",
      "options": [
        "Administer supplemental oxygen",
        "Measuring the pulse and blood pressure",
        "Transfuse with O negative packed red blood cells",
        "IV antibiotics"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This patient is breathing spontaneously but has signs of head trauma and a decreased level of consciousness. The primary survey dictates the immediate steps in managing a critical patient, following the ABCDE sequence. In this case, the airway is patent, and the patient is breathing. However, any patient with a decreased level of consciousness is at risk of hypoxia and respiratory compromise. Therefore, administering supplemental oxygen is the next logical step to ensure adequate oxygenation and prevent secondary brain injury. The textbook states that respiratory support, including oxygen therapy, is crucial to correct hypoxia."

        "7",
        "9",
        "11",
        "13"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to assess the level of consciousness. It has three components: eye opening, verbal response, and motor response.\n\nEye opening: Opens eyes in response to painful stimuli = 2 points.\n\nVerbal response: Incomprehensible moaning = 2 points.\n\nMotor response: Attempts to push your arm away (localizes pain) = 5 points.\n\nTherefore, the total score is 2 + 2 + 5 = 9."

      "options": [
        "Fresh frozen plasma",
        "Inotropes",
        "Isotonic crystalloids",
        "Packed red blood cells transfusion"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of severe pallor, cold extremities, and poor pulses suggests hypovolemic shock due to hemorrhage. The management of shock includes cardiovascular support, and the first step is preload augmentation to correct hypovolemia. The recommended initial fluid is an isotonic crystalloid solution, such as Ringer's lactate or saline, given as a bolus of 20 ml/kg over 10-15 minutes."

    {
      "stem": "While you are working at a community pediatric clinic, a patient's mother calls for help from an adjacent examination room. You see a 4-month-old infant lying motionless on the table. He is not breathing spontaneously. He has no pulses. You determine that this unresponsive pulseless child is in cardiopulmonary arrest. Which of the following is the most common cause of pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest?",
      "options": [
        "Cardiac arrhythmias",
        "Metabolic abnormalities",
        "Malignancies",
        "Respiratory problems"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The textbook explicitly states that most cases of cardiac arrest in children are secondary to a respiratory compromise. Conditions like apnea, hypoxemia, and other respiratory failures are the most frequent precipitators of cardiac arrest in this population."

      "stem": "3-month-old female infant presents to your emergency department unresponsive and with fever, tachypnea, bradycardia, and hypotension. What order should you follow in your initial assessment?",
      "options": [
        "Airway, breathing, circulation, disability, exposure",
        "Breathing, airway, circulation, disability, exposure",
        "Circulation, airway, breathing, exposure, disability",
        "Exposure, breathing, airway, circulation, disability"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This question refers to the initial assessment of a critically ill patient, which is called the primary survey. The textbook outlines the five successive steps that should be performed rapidly in this order: A (Airway), B (Breathing), C (Circulation), D (Disability), and E (Exposure)."

      "stem": "A 5-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with complaints of dizziness confusion and ataxia. 3 days before presentation, he developed a low-grade fever, vomiting and diarrhea 8 to 10 loose motions per day. The boy's mother has been afraid to give him anything but water. Which of the following electrolyte disturbances is likely the cause of the child condition?",
      "options": [
        "Hyperkalemia",
        "Hypochloremia",
        "Hyponatremia",
        "Metabolic alkalosis"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The child presents with signs of neurological dysfunction (dizziness, confusion, ataxia) following a period of gastroenteritis with significant fluid loss (vomiting and diarrhea). The mother's management of only giving water likely led to a state where water intake exceeded electrolyte intake, resulting in hyponatremia. The textbook notes that cellular edema caused by hyponatremia can lead to CNS symptoms such as lethargy and coma."

    {
      "stem": "A 2-year-old toddler was playing with candies and sweets in a playroom when he developed an attack of wheezing and shortness of breath. The parents brought the child to emergency room. Respiratory rate was 68/min with subcostal retractions, and O2 saturation was 92%. Which of the following is the definitive treatment?",
      "options": [
        "Arrange for bedside chest x ray",
        "Arrange for CT chest",
        "Arrange for urgent bronchoscopy",
        "Encourage coughing"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The history of a sudden onset of wheezing and shortness of breath while playing with candies strongly suggests a laryngeal foreign body. The physical exam findings of respiratory distress further support this. The definitive treatment for a foreign body obstruction in the airway is its removal, which is typically done via urgent bronchoscopy."

      "stem": "You are evaluating a 3-year-old conscious child with palpable central pusses and poor perfusion in the emergency department. Which of the following is the most important first step in the treatment?",
      "options": [
        "Epinephrine therapy",
        "Maintaining adequate perfusion by chest compression",
        "Maintaining the airway and assisted breathing",
        "Treating precipitating factors as hypoglycemia"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This child is in a state of circulatory failure (poor perfusion) but is still conscious with palpable central pulses. In a critical situation, the primary survey is followed, beginning with ABCDE. The first and most important step is to maintain a patent airway and provide assisted breathing as needed, as respiratory compromise is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children. While treating the cause (d) is important, it comes after stabilizing the patient's ABCs."

        "Order MRI brain",
        "Wait to see investigations results."
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of ongoing convulsions, drowsiness, and pinpoint pupils after a potential exposure in the kitchen is highly suggestive of organophosphorus poisoning. The initial management of a comatose or convulsing patient includes controlling the convulsions, which can be done with anticonvulsants such as diazepam, phenytoin, or phenobarbitone. Although an antidote is needed, controlling the immediate life-threatening issue (the convulsions) is the first action."

      "options": [
        "Metabolic acidosis",
        "Metabolic alkalosis",
        "Type 1 respiratory failure",
        "Type 2 respiratory failure"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The patient has an impaired level of consciousness, shallow irregular breathing, and an elevated PaCO2 of 62 mmHg. The textbook defines Type 2 respiratory failure as a ventilation failure (hypercapnic RF) with the basic defect being hypoventilation leading to an inability to eliminate CO2. This is associated with a high PaCO2 and can be caused by CNS depression from head trauma."

      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The infant is unresponsive with severe respiratory distress, bilateral pneumonia, and critically abnormal blood gas values (PO2 of 45 mmHg and PCO2 of 65 mmHg). This indicates both hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which are characteristic of respiratory failure. A PaO2 of less than 50 mmHg is defined as severe hypoxemia. The most appropriate next step is to initiate assisted ventilation to support the failing respiratory system."
